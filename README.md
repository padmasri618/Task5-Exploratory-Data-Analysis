##  Visualizations, Content, Insights & Anomalies

### 1. Age Distribution (Histogram)
- **Content**: Shows how ages are distributed.
- **Insight**: Majority of passengers are aged between 20â€“40.
- **Anomaly**: Few infants (<1 year) and very old (>70).

### 2. Survival Count (Countplot)
- **Content**: Compares number of survivors vs non-survivors.
- **Insight**: About 38% survived, 62% didn't.

### 3. Age vs Pclass (Boxplot)
- **Content**: Age spread in each class.
- **Insight**: 1st class passengers are generally older.
- **Anomaly**: Young kids found across all classes.

---

### 4. Survival Rate by Class (Barplot)
- **Insight**: Higher class passengers had significantly better survival chances.

### 5. Survival Rate by Sex (Barplot)
- **Insight**: Females were far more likely to survive.
- **Anomaly**: Male survival rate drops across all classes.

---

### 6. Survival Rate by Embarked Port (Barplot)
- **Insight**: Passengers from Cherbourg (C) had the highest survival rate.

---

### 7. Correlation Heatmap
- **Content**: Shows how features correlate with each other.
- **Insight**: Fare is positively correlated with survival; Pclass negatively.

---

### 8. Pairplot: Survival vs Numerical Features
- **Content**: Plots pairwise relationships of numerical features.
- **Insight**: High Fare and lower class indicate higher survival.

## Key Insights
- Women and children were prioritized in rescue.
- Passengers in 1st class had better facilities and escape chances.
- High fare and boarding from Cherbourg are associated with survival.
- Missing data in `Age`, `Cabin` should be handled before modeling.
